# Week 2

Welcome to week 2! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week we’re covering linear regression with multiple variables. we’ll show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression.

We’re also going to go over how to use Octave. You’ll work on programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB.

As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.)
